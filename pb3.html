    <h3>Princess Bonnibel "Bonnie" Bubblegum (often called PB and occasionally Peebles or P-Bubs) is a main character in the series Adventure Time.</h3>
    <p>
        Princess Bubblegum is the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental, comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, who are all composed of types of desserts and candies. She rules over the Candy Kingdom, but in the Season 6 episode "Hot Diggity Doom" (the first part of the season's finale), an election was held and she lost to the King of Ooo by a landslide. As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in "The Dark Cloud."

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Princess Bubblegum is a sentient, humanoid-construct of pink gum and has been revealed to be the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental (the Elementals are the embodiments of the four main elements that make up the world: ice, fire, candy, and slime. They have existed since the beginning of life, living, dying and reincarnating for eons and millennia). Although Princess Bubblegum appeared to be in her late teens, she is in fact much older than she looks.
    </p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>
        While Princess Bubblegum is typically kind, good-hearted and well-mannered, she can be very temperamental and has shown a malicious aspect of her personality whenever she is crossed. Even with her kind disposition, her moral code is not strict as some of the other characters and there are also hints of a darker aspect of her personality.Bubblegum also adores the people of her kingdom and puts their safety above all else. In her dedication, she sometimes drives herself to exhaustion with her tasks. She is also a rational thinker with skepticism towards magic, labeling it as "scientific principles presented like mystical hoodoo." She also claims that "all magic is science."
